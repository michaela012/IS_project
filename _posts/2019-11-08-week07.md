This week I focused on analyzing the colors for each image in the collection. There are several options for doing this, and I ended up using k-means clustering. Essentially, this method allows for finding the dominant colors in the image. This differs from just finding the average color composition of an image, as with this latter method, the result would be a muddle of colors that might not reflect any of the colors in the image at all. For a multi-colored image, finding the average color would likely yield a shade of brown. 

As a simple example, imagine a tryptich image with just three pure red, green, and blue panels. The RGB values of each of these panels would be (255,0,0), (0,255,0), and (0,0,255), respectively:

![]("is_project/img/week07_red.png")
![]("is_project/img/week07_green.png")
![]("is_project/img/week07_blue.png")

A k-means method with three clusters would yield three distinct values. Since we're looking at a tryptich with only three colors, these are the colors the k-means analysis would yield. By contrast, the average color of the image would be a combination of those three. This would be a strange shade of greysih, purpleish brown:

![]("is_project/img/week07_mix.png")

Clearly, the above color clusters are more relevant than the average.
