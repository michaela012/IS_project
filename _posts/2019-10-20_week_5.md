This week (and a little last week), the readings are focused on digital humanities projects in museum spaces. This is a nice parallel to project work, as I'm getting started working with real data-- though it seems like the week might be mostly focused on cleaning. There are a lot of questions that come along with cleaning the data that I hadn't thought about in advance, since not all the fields are standardized or populated. The question 'what do we do with the outliers', or fields that aren't completed the way we might hope they'd be, isn't just a question of how to get the data into a workable form. Rather, it's a pretty significant interprative act.
