This week (and a little last week), the readings are focused on digital humanities projects in museum spaces. This is a nice parallel to project work, as I'm getting started working with real data-- though it seems like the week might be mostly focused on cleaning. There are a lot of questions that come along with cleaning the data that I hadn't thought about in advance, since not all the fields are standardized or populated. The question 'what do we do with the outliers', or fields that aren't completed the way we might hope they'd be, isn't just a question of how to get the data into a workable form. Rather, it's a pretty significant interprative act. 

Originally, my first small visualization project plan involved using the 'culture' or 'period' markers associated with each piece. Unfortuantely, after looking at the data more closely, it turned out that these fields weren't populated for nearly any of the pieces in the collection (out of 16243 objects, 14892 were missing values for the first category, and 16116 were missing for the second). My second, main project was supposed to use ULAN identifiers in order to gather more information about artists. While this field was more populated than the two discussed before, nearly half of the pieces were still missing this information (for 8565 pieces the ULAN id was marked 'not found'). I expected a non-trivial number of pieces to be missing this data: since, for example, it is usually not possible to identify the creator of objects found from archeological digs, there could be no artist information associated with these sort of pieces. Still, I didn't expect this many to be missing. 

Additionally, many of the pieces that did have this information were by the same artists (as would be expected), but again, the scale was surprising. For example, the three artists most prominent in the collection are [Rube Goldberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg), [Thomas Nast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Nast), and [Andy Warhol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol). There are 549 of Goldberg's pieces, 463 of Nast's, and 326 of Warhol's. It seems that WCMA houses a lot of cartoons! :) 

Actually, it could itself be a fun small project to create a visualization of the most prominent artists in the collection that links ways to learn more about them. Though I would be a bit surprised if they don't already have something similar!
